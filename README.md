# KAPPA
Kinetic Approach to Physical Processes in Atmospheres is an open-source library written in C++ and developed at the Department of Hydroaeromechanics of the Saint Petersburg State University (SPBSU), designed to be coupled with conventional CFD codes to provide thermodynamic, transport, chemistry, and energy transfer properties associated with non-equilibrium reacting flows.
