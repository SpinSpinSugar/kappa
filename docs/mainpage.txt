@section Introduction

@kappa is open-source library written in C++ and developed at the Department of Hydroaeromechanics of the Saint Petersburg State University (SPBSU).

The aim of @kappa is to provide thermodynamic, transport, chemistry, and energy transfer properties associated with non-equilibrium reacting flows.

The main features of @kappa are the following:
- Implements rigorous sound mathematical kinetic models:
  - Vibrational State-to-State (STS);
  - 1-temperature;
  - multi-temperatures.

@note
<b>Compiling Instructions</b> \n
@kappa is shipped with a CMakeLists.txt file for compiling the codes on Unix/GNU Linux architectures. Other OS are not supported. For more details see \ref Compiling "Compiling Instructions".

@subsection ThirdParty Thirdparty packages

@kappa uses tow external thirdparty packages:
- YAML;
- Armadillo.

@section CompilersList List of Supported Compilers

@kappa has been developed on GNU/Linux architectures. 

The codes provided has been successfully compiled with the following compilers:

- GNU gfortran (version 4.8.5 or higher)
- Intel Fortran Compiler ifort (version 17.0 or higher)

@section CompInst Compiling Instructions

The code is constituted by several modules. Therefore there are many dependences. The easiest way to compile the code is to start with the provided CMakeLists.txt file.

Once the thirdparty dependences are installed, examples of compiling are:
- @kappa code with default options:
  @code
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make 
  make install
  make test
  @endcode
